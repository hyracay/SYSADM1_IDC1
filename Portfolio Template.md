> ## **Course Reflection**

**What were your initial expectations for the course? Did the course meet, exceed, or fall short of these expectations?**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
My initial expectation was that this subject is going to be harder than server administration which I finished last semester. In a way, it really was more challenging, however, due to the limitations of our assigned laboratory and the unfortunate series of class suspensions,
I was not able to fully grasp or master the lessons that we were supposed to simulate especially the linux bash commands. I can say that I have learned enough but not as much as I expected or would have liked.

**What were the main topics or concepts covered in the course? How did these topics contribute to your understanding of the subject matter?**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Reflecting on your learning process, what were the most effective strategies or techniques that helped you grasp and retain the course material?**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Were there any particular assignments, projects, or activities that significantly enhanced your learning experience? Why were they effective?**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
The kerberos lab activity or FLW1 was particularly entertaining for me as it required me to troubleshoot system problems in Linux environment and forced me to develop my own strategies as to how I should complete the task. Although I wasn't able to finish the lab activity in time, I still made the decision to
continue the task at home despite not being required to. I'm glad I did because I was able to learn about basic kerberos authentication through ticket based access which was the whole point of the activity. This kind of lab activity is effective for me and I consider it as a "good" stress. First I stress myself out in the lab then I troubleshoot freely at home. It is effective because I get to apply critical thinking on my own without too much constraints such as time pressure and hardware issues.

**Reflecting on your personal growth, what new knowledge, skills, or perspectives did you gain from this course?**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
